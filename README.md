# Convertible Bond Pricing with Soft Call Provision: A Machine Learning Approach

## Executive Summary
This project develops and evaluates comprehensive pricing models for convertible bonds with n-out-of-m soft call provisions. By combining traditional financial theory with advanced machine learning techniques, we create a robust framework for accurate price prediction. The research is based on Zhang's "Looking Backward" method and extends it through modern computational approaches.

## Background Research

### Theoretical Foundation
The research builds upon the paper 'Back To the Future - An Approximate Solution for n out of m Soft-call Option' by Joshua Xingzhi Zhang. This work addresses the fundamental challenge of pricing convertible bonds with complex soft call features, particularly focusing on the path-dependent nature of these financial instruments. For our project, we have focused on 20-out-of-30 days soft call provision on a convertible bond.

### Problem Definition
Convertible bonds with soft call provisions present unique pricing challenges:
1. Path Dependency: The bond's value depends on the historical path of stock prices
2. Monitoring Requirements: Stock must exceed barrier price for specific number of days
3. Complex Optionality: Combination of conversion rights and call provisions
4. Computational Intensity: Traditional methods require extensive calculations

### Market Context
Soft-call constraints serve multiple purposes in financial markets:
1. Protection of conversion privileges
2. Risk management for issuers and investors
3. Market efficiency enhancement
4. Pricing complexity management
